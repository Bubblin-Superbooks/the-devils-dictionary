How profitless the labor you bestow
    Upon a dwelling whose magnificence
The tenant neither can admire nor know.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Build deep, build high, build massive as you can,
The wanton grass-roots will defeat the plan
    By shouldering asunder all the stones
In what to you would be a moment's span.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>Time</blockquote></div> </div>
