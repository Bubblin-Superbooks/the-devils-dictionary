And lexicographers arose, a swarm!
Thought fled and left her clothing, which they took,
And catalogued each garment in a book.

"Give me my clothes and I'll return," they rise
And scan the list, and say without compassion:
"Excuse usâ€”they are mostly out of fashion."</p></blockquote><p>Sigismund Smith</p><p>LIAR, n. A lawyer with a roving commission.</p><p>LIBERTY, n. One of Imagination's most precious possessions.</p><blockquote class="  "><p>The rising People, hot and out of breath,
Roared around the palace:  "Liberty or death!"
