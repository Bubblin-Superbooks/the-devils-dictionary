    And take some special measure for redeeming it;
Though hard indeed the task to get it in
    Among the angels any way but teaming it,
    Or purify it otherwise than steaming it.
I'm awkward at Redemptionâ€”a beginner:
My method is to crucify the sinner.</p></blockquote><p>Golgo Brone</p><p>REDRESS, n. Reparation without satisfaction.</p><p>Among the Anglo-Saxon a subject conceiving himself wronged by the king was permitted, on proving his injury, to beat a brazen image of the royal offender with a switch that was afterward applied to his own naked back. The latter rite was performed by the public hangman, and it assured moderation in the plaintiff's choice of a switch.</p></div> </div>
