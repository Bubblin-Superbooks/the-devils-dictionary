<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">the King said, "let me reign;
You'll have, I'm sure, no reason to complain."</p></blockquote><p>Martha Braymance</p><p>LICKSPITTLE, n. A useful functionary, not infrequently found editing a newspaper. In his character of editor he is closely allied to the blackmailer by the tie of occasional identity; for in truth the lickspittle is only the blackmailer under another aspect, although the latter is frequently found as an independent species. Lickspittling is more detestable than blackmailing, precisely as the business of a confidence man is more detestable than that of a highway robber; and the parallel maintains itself throughout, for whereas few robbers will cheat, every sneak will plunder if he dare.</p></div> </div>
