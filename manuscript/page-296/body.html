    And, therefore, was detested,
Was one day with a tarry coat
    (With feathers backed and breasted)
    By patriots invested.
"It is your duty," cried the crowd,
    "Your ballot true to cast
For the man o' your choice."  He humbly bowed,
    And explained his wicked past:
"That's what I very gladly would have done,
Dear patriots, but he has never run."</p></blockquote><p>Apperton Duke</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">MANES, n. The immortal parts of dead Greeks and Romans. They were in a state of dull discomfort until the bodies from which they had exhaled were buried</p></div> </div>
