The outward and visible sign of an inward fear.</p><blockquote><pre><code>    He saw a ghost.</code></pre>
<p>It occupied—that dismal thing!—
The path that he was following.
Before he'd time to stop and fly,
An earthquake trifled with the eye
        That saw a ghost.
He fell as fall the early good;
Unmoved that awful vision stood.
The stars that danced before his ken
He wildly brushed away, and then
        He saw a post.</p></blockquote><p>Jared Macphester</p></div> </div>
