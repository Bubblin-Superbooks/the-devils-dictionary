<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>D</h4><p class="  start-chapter">DAMN, v. A word formerly much used by the Paphlagonians, the meaning of which is lost. By the learned Dr. Dolabelly Gak it is believed to have been a term of satisfaction, implying the highest possible degree of mental tranquillity. Professor Groke, on the contrary, thinks it expressed an emotion of tumultuous delight, because it so frequently occurs in combination with the word <em>jod</em> or <em>god</em>, meaning "joy." It would be with great diffidence that I should advance an opinion conflicting with that of either of these formidable authorities.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">DANCE, v.i.
