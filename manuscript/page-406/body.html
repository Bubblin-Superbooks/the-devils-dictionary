The first of these rights was once universally believed to be derived directly from the will of God; and this is still sometimes affirmed <em>in partibus infidelium</em> outside the enlightened realms of Democracy; as the well known lines of Sir Abednego Bink, following:</p><blockquote><pre><code>By what right, then, do royal rulers rule?
