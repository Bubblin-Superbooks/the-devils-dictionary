<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>FIB, n. A lie that has not cut its teeth. An habitual liar's nearest approach to truth: the perigee of his eccentric orbit.</p><blockquote><p>When David said:  "All men are liars," Dave,
    Himself a liar, fibbed like any thief.
    Perhaps he thought to weaken disbelief
By proof that even himself was not a slave
To Truth; though I suspect the aged knave
    Had been of all her servitors the chief
    Had he but known a fig's reluctant leaf
Is more than e'er she wore on land or wave.
No, David served not Naked Truth when he
    Struck that sledge-hammer blow at all his race;
        Nor did he hit the nail upon the head:
For reason shows that it could never be,
    And the facts contradict him to his face.
        Men are not liars all, for some are dead.</p></blockquote><p>Bartle Quinker</p></div> </div>
