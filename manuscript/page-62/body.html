<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>As Death was a-rising out one day,
Across Mount Camel he took his way,
    Where he met a mendicant monk,
    Some three or four quarters drunk,
With a holy leer and a pious grin,
Ragged and fat and as saucy as sin,
    Who held out his hands and cried:
"Give, give in Charity's name, I pray.
Give in the name of the Church.  O give,
Give that her holy sons may live!"
    And Death replied,
    Smiling long and wide:
    "I'll give, holy father, I'll give theeâ€”a ride."</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><pre><code>With a rattle and bang
Of his bones, he sprang</code></pre>
<p>From his famous Pale Horse, with his spear;
    By the neck and the foot
    Seized the fellow, and put
Him astride</blockquote></div> </div>
