<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">sad,
While all the church bells made a solemn din—
A fire-alarm to those who lived in sin.
Then saw I gazing thoughtfully below,
With tranquil face, upon that holy show
A tall, spare figure in a robe of white,
Whose eyes diffused a melancholy light.
"God keep you, stranger," I exclaimed.  "You are
No doubt (your habit shows it) from afar;
And yet I entertain the hope that you,
Like these good people, are a Christian too."
He raised his eyes and with a look so stern
It made me with a thousand blushes burn
Replied—his manner with disdain was spiced:
"What!  I a Christian?  No, indeed!  I'm Christ."</p></blockquote><p>G.J.</p><p>CIRCUS, n. A place where horses, ponies and elephants are permitted to see men, women and children acting the fool.</p></div> </div>
