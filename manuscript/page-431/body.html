            Beneath the great oak tree.
        He'd traveled in a foreign land.
        He tried to make her understand
        The dance that's called the Saraband,
            But he called it Scarabee.</code></pre>
<p>He had called it so through an afternoon,
    And she, the light of his harem if so might be,
    Had smiled and said naught.  O the body was fair to see,
All frosted there in the shine o' the moonâ€”
                    Dead for a Scarabee
And a recollection that came too late.
                        O Fate!
                They buried him where he lay,
                He sleeps awaiting the Day,
                        In state,
And two Possible Puns, moon-eyed and wan,
Gloom over the grave and then move on.
                    Dead for a Scarabee!
