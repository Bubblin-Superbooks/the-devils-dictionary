<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">visible universe may be a small part of an atom, with its component ions, floating in the life-fluid (luminiferous ether) of some animal.

A bird whose thievish disposition suggested to someone that it might be taught to talk.</p><p>MAIDEN, n. A young person of the unfair sex addicted to clewless conduct and views that madden to crime. The genus has a wide geographical distribution, being found wherever sought and deplored wherever found. The maiden is not altogether unpleasing to the eye, nor (without her piano and her views) insupportable to the ear, though in respect to comeliness distinctly inferior to the rainbow, and, with regard to the part of her that is audible, bleaten out of the field by the canaryâ€”which, also, is more portable.</p></div> </div>
