<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>I sit astride Parnassus with my lyre,
And pick with care the disobedient wire.
That stupid shepherd lolling on his crook
With deaf attention scarcely deigns to look.
I bide my time, and it shall come at length,
When, with a Titan's energy and strength,
I'll grab a fistful of the strings, and O,
The word shall suffer when I let them go!</p></blockquote><p>Farquharson Harris</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
