A religious celebration usually signalized by gluttony and drunkenness, frequently in honor of some holy person distinguished for abstemiousness. In the Roman Catholic Church feasts are "movable" and "immovable," but the celebrants are uniformly immovable until they are full. In their earliest development these entertainments took the form of feasts for the dead; such were held by the Greeks, under the name <em>Nemeseia</em>, by the Aztecs and Peruvians, as in modern times they are popular with the Chinese; though it is believed that the ancient dead, like the modern, were light eaters. Among the many feasts of the Romans was the <em>Novemdiale</em>, which was held, according to Livy, whenever stones fell from heaven.</p><p>FELON, n. A person of greater enterprise than discretion, who in embracing an opportunity has formed an unfortunate attachment.</p></div> </div>
