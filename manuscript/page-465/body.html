I hold that that's the stomach's function,
For of the sinner I have noted
That when he's sinned he's somewhat bloated,
Or ill some other ghastly fashion
Within that bowel of compassion.
True, I believe the only sinner
Is he that eats a shabby dinner.
You know how Adam with good reason,
For eating apples out of season,
Was "cursed."  But that is all symbolic:
The truth is, Adam had the colic.</p></blockquote><p>G.J.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
