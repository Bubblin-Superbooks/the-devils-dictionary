And a tender, melancholy grace.
    Improbable 'twas, no doubt,
    When you came to think it out,
    But the fascinated crowd
    Their deep surprise avowed
And all with a single voice averred
'Twas the most amazing thing they'd heard—
All save one who spake never a word,
    But sat as mum
    As if deaf and dumb,
Serene, indifferent and unstirred.
    Then all the others turned to him
    And scrutinized him limb from limb—
    Scanned him alive;
    But he seemed to thrive
    And tranquiler grow each minute,
    As if there were nothing in it.
"What! what!" cried one, "are you not amazed
At what our friend has told?"  He raised
Soberly then his eyes and gazed
    In a natural way
    And proceeded to say,
As he crossed his feet on the mantel-shelf:
"O no—not at all; I'm a liar myself."</p></blockquote></div> </div>
