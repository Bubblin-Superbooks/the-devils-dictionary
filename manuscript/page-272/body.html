The salesman smiled in a manner mild,
Like an artless, undesigning child;
Then, checking himself, to his face he gave
A look as sorrowful as the grave,
    Though he didn't care two figs
For her pains and throes,
As he stroked her toes,
Remarking with speech and manner just
Befitting his calling:  "Madam, I trust
    That it doesn't hurt your twigs."</p></blockquote><p>B. Percival Dike</p><p>LINEN, n.
