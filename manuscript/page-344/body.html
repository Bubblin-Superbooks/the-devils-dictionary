<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">respect to an enlightened but inferior lexicographer I beg to submit that it is the first.</p><p>PEACE, n. In international affairs, a period of cheating between two periods of fighting.</p><blockquote><p>O, what's the loud uproar assailing
    Mine ears without cease?
'Tis the voice of the hopeful, all-hailing
    The horrors of peace.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Ah, Peace Universal; they woo itâ€”
    Would marry it, too.
If only they knew how to do it
    'Twere easy to do.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>They're working by night and by day
    On their problem, like moles.
Have mercy, O Heaven, I pray,
    On their meddlesome souls!</p></blockquote></div> </div>
