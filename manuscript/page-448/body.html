    The maidens hold high revel;
In sinful mood, insanely gay,
True spinsters spin adown the way
    From duty to the devil!
They laugh, they sing, and—ting-a-ling!
    Their bells go all the morning;
Their lanterns bright bestar the night
    Pedestrians a-warning.
With lifted hands Miss Charlotte stands,
    Good-Lording and O-mying,
Her rheumatism forgotten quite,
    Her fat with anger frying.
She blocks the path that leads to wrath,
    Jack Satan's power defying.
The wheels go round without a sound
    The lights burn red and blue and green.
What's this that's found upon the ground?
    Poor Charlotte Smith's a smithareen!</p></blockquote><p>John William Yope</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">SOPHISTRY, n. The controversial method of an opponent, distinguished from one's own by superior</p></div> </div>
