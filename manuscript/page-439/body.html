Our word "sincere" is derived from <em>sine cero</em>, without wax, but the learned are not in agreement as to whether this refers to the absence of the cabalistic signs, or to that of the wax with which letters were formerly closed from public scrutiny. Either view of the matter will serve one in immediate need of an hypothesis. The initials L.S., commonly appended to signatures of legal documents, mean <em>locum sigillis</em>, the place of the seal, although the seal is no longer used â€”an admirable example of conservatism distinguishing Man from the beasts that perish. The words <em>locum sigillis</em> are humbly suggested as a suitable motto for the Pribyloff Islands whenever they shall take their place as a sovereign State of the American Union.</p></div> </div>
