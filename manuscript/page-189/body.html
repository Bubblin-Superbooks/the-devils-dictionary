    A Christian philosopher.  I'm
A scurril agnostical chap, if you please,
    Addicted too much to the crime
    Of religious discussion in my rhyme.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Though Hebrew and Howison cannot agree
    On a _modus vivendi_—not they!—
Yet Heaven has had the designing of me,
    And I haven't been reared in a way
    To joy in the thick of the fray.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>For this of my creed is the soul and the gist,
    And the truth of it I aver:
Who differs from me in his faith is an 'ist,
    And 'ite, an 'ie, or an 'er—
    And I'm down upon him or her!</p></blockquote></div> </div>
