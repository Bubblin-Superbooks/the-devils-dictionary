Your friends in Illinois when held in thrall."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"Unhappy soul! for that alone you squirm
O'er fire unquenched, a never-dying worm.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"Yet, for I pity your uneasy state,
Your doom I'll mollify and pains abate.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"Naught, for a season, shall your comfort mar,
Not even the memory of who you are."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Throughout eternal space dread silence fell;
Heaven trembled as Compassion entered Hell.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
