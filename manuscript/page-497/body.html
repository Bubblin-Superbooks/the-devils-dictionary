    There's nothing vital in the eggs they've laid;

A study of mankind, who say that men
Whose business 'tis to drive the tongue or pen
    Make the most clamorous fanfaronade
    O'er their most worthless work; and I'm afraid
They're not entirely different from the hen.
Lo! the drum-major in his coat of gold,
    His blazing breeches and high-towering capâ€”
Imperiously pompous, grandly bold,
    Grim, resolute, an awe-inspiring chap!
Who'd think this gorgeous creature's only virtue
Is that in battle he will never hurt you?</p></blockquote><p>Hannibal Hunsiker</p><p>VIRTUES, n.pl. Certain abstentions.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">VITUPERATION, n. Satire, as understood by dunces and all such as suffer from an impediment in</p></div> </div>
