<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">year
Which does no more than just commence
    Before the end is near?
When I was young the year extended
From month to month until it ended.
I know not why the world has changed
    To something dark and dreary,
And everything is now arranged
    To make a fellow weary.
    The Weather Manâ€”I fear he
Has much to do with it, for, sure,
    The air is not the same:
It chokes you when it is impure,
    When pure it makes you lame.
With windows closed you are asthmatic;
Open, neuralgic or sciatic.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Well, I suppose this new regime
    Of dun degeneration
Seems eviler than it would seem
    To a better observation,
    And has for compensation
Some blessings in a deep disguise
    Which mortal sight has failed
To pierce, although to angels' eyes
    They're visible unveiled.
If Age is such a boon, good land!
He's costumed by a master hand!</p></blockquote></div> </div>
