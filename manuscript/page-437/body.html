<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>Dear Frank, that scrap-book where you boast
    You keep a record true
Of every kind of peppered roast
        That's made of you;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Wherein you paste the printed gibes
    That revel round your name,
Thinking the laughter of the scribes
        Attests your fame;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Where all the pictures you arrange
    That comic pencils trace—
Your funny figure and your strange
        Semitic face—</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Pray lend it me.  Wit I have not,
    Nor art, but there I'll list
The daily drubbings you'd have got
        Had God a fist.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
