<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">a lonely grave I stood—
    With brambles 'twas encumbered;
The winds were moaning in the wood,
    Unheard by him who slumbered,</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>A rustic standing near, I said:
    "He cannot hear it blowing!"
"'Course not," said he:  "the feller's dead—
    He can't hear nowt [sic] that's going."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"Too true," I said; "alas, too true—
    No sound his sense can quicken!"
"Well, mister, wot is that to you?—
    The deadster ain't a-kickin'."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I knelt and prayed:  "O Father, smile
    On him, and mercy show him!"
That countryman looked on the while,
    And said:  "Ye didn't know him."</p></blockquote></div> </div>
