    Ever and ever so long ago,
And he had a head, the phrenologists said,
    That fitted him for a show.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>For his modesty's bump was so large a lump
    (Nature, they said, had taken a freak)
That its summit stood far above the wood
    Of his hair, like a mountain peak.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>So modest a man in all Ispahan,
    Over and over again they sworeâ€”
So humble and meek, you would vainly seek;
