<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>SEINE, n. A kind of net for effecting an involuntary change of environment. For fish it is made strong and coarse, but women are more easily taken with a singularly delicate fabric weighted with small, cut stones.</p><blockquote><p>The devil casting a seine of lace,
    (With precious stones 'twas weighted)
Drew it into the landing place
    And its contents calculated.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>All souls of women were in that sackâ€”
    A draft miraculous, precious!
But ere he could throw it across his back
    They'd all escaped through the meshes.</p></blockquote><p>Baruch de Loppis</p><p>SELF-ESTEEM, n. An erroneous appraisement.</p></div> </div>
