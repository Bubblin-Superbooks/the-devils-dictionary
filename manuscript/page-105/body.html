    I hold; and wish that it had been my lot
    To live my life out in some favored spot—
Some country where it is considered nice
To split a rival like a fish, or slice
    A husband like a spud, or with a shot
    Bring down a debtor doubled in a knot
And ready to be put upon the ice.
Some miscreants there are, whom I do long
    To shoot, to stab, or some such way reclaim
The scurvy rogues to better lives and manners,
I seem to see them now—a mighty throng.
    It looks as if to challenge <em>me</em> they came,
Jauntily marching with brass bands and banners!</p></blockquote><p>Xamba Q. Dar</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">DULLARD, n. A member of the reigning dynasty in letters and life. The Dullards came in with Adam,</p></div> </div>
