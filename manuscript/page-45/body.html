He loseth all the skin he hath,
And, for he's boiled a brilliant red,
Thinketh to cleanliness he's wed,
Forgetting that his lungs he's soiling
With dirty vapors of the boiling.</p></blockquote><p>Richard Gwow</p><p>BATTLE, n. A method of untying with the teeth of a political knot that would not yield to the tongue.</p><p>BEARD, n.
