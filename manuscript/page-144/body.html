    In a thick volume, and all authors known,
    If not thy glory yet thy power have shown,
Deign to take homage from thy son who hunts
Through all thy maze his brothers, fool and dunce,
    To mend their lives and to sustain his own,

    With lusty lung, here on his western strand
    With all thine offspring thronged</blockquote></div> </div>
