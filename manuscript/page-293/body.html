    This quaint, sweet song sang she;
"It's O for a youth with a football bang
    And a muscle fair to see!
            The Captain he
            Of a team to be!
On the gridiron he shall shine,
A monarch by right divine,
    And never to roast on it—me!"</p></blockquote><p>Opoline Jones</p><p>MAJESTY, n. The state and title of a king.
