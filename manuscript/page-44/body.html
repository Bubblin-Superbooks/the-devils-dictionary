A sort of serpent hatched from the egg of a cock. The basilisk had a bad eye, and its glance was fatal. Many infidels deny this creature's existence, but Semprello Aurator saw and handled one that had been blinded by lightning as a punishment for having fatally gazed on a lady of rank whom Jupiter loved. Juno afterward restored the reptile's sight and hid it in a cave. Nothing is so well attested by the ancients as the existence of the basilisk, but the cocks have stopped laying.</p><p>BASTINADO, n. The act of walking on wood without exertion.</p><p>BATH, n. A kind of mystic ceremony substituted for religious worship, with what spiritual efficacy has not been determined.</p></div> </div>
