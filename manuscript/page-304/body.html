Etymologically, the word means unbeliever, and its present signification may be regarded as theology's noblest contribution to the development of our language.</p><p>MISDEMEANOR, n. An infraction of the law having less dignity than a felony and constituting no claim to admittance into the best criminal society.</p><blockquote><p>By misdemeanors he essays to climb
Into the aristocracy of crime.
O, woe was him!â€”with manner chill and grand
"Captains of industry" refused his hand,
"Kings of finance" denied him recognition
And "railway magnates" jeered his low condition.
He robbed a bank to make himself respected.
They still rebuffed him, for he was detected.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
