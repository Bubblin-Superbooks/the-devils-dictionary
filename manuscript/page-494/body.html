One who forgoes the advantage of a Hell for persons of another faith.</p><p>URBANITY, n. The kind of civility that urban observers ascribe to dwellers in all cities but New York. Its commonest expression is heard in the words, "I beg your pardon," and it is not inconsistent with disregard of the rights of others.</p><blockquote><p>The owner of a powder mill
Was musing on a distant hill—
    Something his mind foreboded—
When from the cloudless sky there fell
A deviled human kidney!  Well,
    The man's mill had exploded.
His hat he lifted from his head;
"I beg your pardon, sir," he said;
    "I didn't know 'twas loaded."</p></blockquote></div> </div>
