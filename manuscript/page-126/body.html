    When on thy stool of penitence I sit
I'm quite converted, for I can't get up.
Ungrateful he who afterward would falter
To make new sacrifices at thine altar!</p></blockquote><p>EXCOMMUNICATION, n.</p><blockquote><p>This "excommunication" is a word
In speech ecclesiastical oft heard,
And means the damning, with bell, book and candle,
Some sinner whose opinions are a scandalâ€”
A rite permitting Satan to enslave him
Forever, and forbidding Christ to save him.</p></blockquote><p>Gat Huckle</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">EXECUTIVE, n. An officer of the Government,</p></div> </div>
