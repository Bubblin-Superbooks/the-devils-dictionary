Its form, that of a heavy club, indicates its original purpose and use in dissuading from dissent.</p><p>MACHINATION, n. The method employed by one's opponents in baffling one's open and honorable efforts to do the right thing.</p><blockquote><p>So plain the advantages of machination
It constitutes a moral obligation,
And honest wolves who think upon't with loathing
Feel bound to don the sheep's deceptive clothing.
So prospers still the diplomatic art,
And Satan bows, with hand upon his heart.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
