The doctrine, or belief, that everything is beautiful, including what is ugly, everything good, especially the bad, and everything right that is wrong.

Being a blind faith, it is inaccessible to the light of disproofâ€”an intellectual disorder, yielding to no treatment but death. It is hereditary, but fortunately not contagious.</p><p>OPTIMIST, n. A proponent of the doctrine that black is white.</p><p>A pessimist applied to God for relief.</p><p>"Ah, you wish me to restore your hope and cheerfulness," said God.</p></div> </div>
