    He'd slay them all for winking.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>What should they do?  They were not hot
    To hazard such disaster;
They dared not close an eyeâ€”dared not
    See better than their master.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Seeing them lacrymose and glum,
    A leech consoled the weepers:
He spread small rags with liquid gum
    And covered half their peepers.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The court all wore the stuff, the flame
    Of royal anger dying.
That's how court-plaster got its name
    Unless I'm greatly lying.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
