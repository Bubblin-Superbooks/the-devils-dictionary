<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>REVOLUTION, n. In politics, an abrupt change in the form of misgovernment. Specifically, in American history, the substitution of the rule of an Administration for that of a Ministry, whereby the welfare and happiness of the people were advanced a full half-inch. Revolutions are usually accompanied by a considerable effusion of blood, but are accounted worth itâ€”this appraisement being made by beneficiaries whose blood had not the mischance to be shed. The French revolution is of incalculable value to the Socialist of to-day; when he pulls the string actuating its bones its gestures are inexpressibly terrifying to gory tyrants suspected of fomenting law and order.</p><p>RHADOMANCER, n. One who uses a divining-rod in prospecting for precious metals in the pocket of a fool.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">RIBALDRY, n. Censorious language by another</p></div> </div>
