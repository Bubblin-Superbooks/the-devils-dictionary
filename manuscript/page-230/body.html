    The good philanthropist replied;
"I did great service to a man one day
Who never since has cursed me to repay,
            Nor vilified."</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>"Ho!" cried the cynic, "lead me to him straight—
    With veneration I am overcome,
And fain would have his blessing."  "Sad your fate—
He cannot bless you, for I grieve to state
            This man is dumb."</p></blockquote><p>Ariel Selp</p><p>INJURY, n. An offense next in degree of enormity to a slight.</p></div> </div>
