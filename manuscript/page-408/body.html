<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">characteristic passage from which is here given:</p><blockquote><pre><code>"Now righteousness consisteth not merely in a holy state of</code></pre>
<p>mind, nor yet in performance of religious rites and obedience to
the letter of the law.  It is not enough that one be pious and
just:  one must see to it that others also are in the same state;
and to this end compulsion is a proper means.  Forasmuch as my
injustice may work ill to another, so by his injustice may evil be
wrought upon still another, the which it is as manifestly my duty
to estop as to forestall mine own tort.  Wherefore if I would be
righteous I am bound to restrain my neighbor, by force if needful,
in all those injurious enterprises from which, through a better
disposition and by the help of Heaven, I do myself refrain."</p></blockquote></div> </div>
