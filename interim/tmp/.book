In that year a large part of it was published in covers with the title <em>The Cynic's Word Book</em>, a name which the author had not the power to reject or happiness to approve. To quote the publishers of the present work:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">\"This more reverent title had previously been forced upon him by the religious scruples of the last newspaper in which a part of the work had appeared, with the natural consequence that when it came out in covers the</p>",

Among them, they brought the word 'cynic' into disfavor so deep that any book bearing it was discredited in advance of publication.\"</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Meantime, too, some of the enterprising humorists of the country had helped themselves to such parts of the work as served their needs, and many of its definitions, anecdotes, phrases and so forth, had become more or less current in popular speech.

The properties of ink are peculiar and contradictory: it may be used to make reputations and unmake them; to blacken them and to make them white; but it is most generally and acceptably employed as a mortar to bind together the stones of an edifice of fame, and as a whitewash to conceal afterward the rascal quality of the material. There are men called journalists who have established ink baths which some persons pay money to get into, others to get out of.
